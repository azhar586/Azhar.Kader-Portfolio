                <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with either "X" or "O." The goal is to be the first to align three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal. In this version, one player competes against the computer, which makes its moves based on a strategic algorithm.</p>
