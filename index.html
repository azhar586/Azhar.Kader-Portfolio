                <h3>Snake Game</h3>
                <p>The objective of the Snake game is to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food items that appear randomly. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. The goal is to make the snake as long as possible without colliding with the walls or its own body. The game ends when the snake crashes into a wall or itself.</p>

                <h3>Space Invaders</h3>
                <p>To shoot in the game, you need to press the spacebar or Enter key on your keyboard. This triggers the creation of a bullet that will travel upwards from your spaceship, and it will attempt to hit the invaders</p>
